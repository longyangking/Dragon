#Review of 1D FDTD

##Skills

###Basic Form Change:
Based on Inverse Fourier Transform

Frequency Form -> Time Convolution Integral Form -> Numerical Sum Form -> Iterative Form

###Auxiliary Differential Equation Method (ADE)
Frequency Form -> Time Differential Equation Form -> Numerical Finite Differential Form -> Iterative Form

###Z Transformation
Frequency Form -> Iterative Form
